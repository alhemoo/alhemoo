- 👋 Hi, I’m @alhemoo
- 👀 I’m very interested in UX design. To me, UX design incorporates a bit of everything that I love: design, psychology, marketing, research, and, most importantly, technology.
- 🌱 I’m continually learning more about UX, leaning towards research and data analysis, while also keeping up with coding in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on UX case studies or projects. I'm interested in meeting new people and discovering more about our beautiful community.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me by sending an email to alec.mompoint@hec.ca."
